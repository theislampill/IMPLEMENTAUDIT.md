# Route-decision and obligation authority (R0033 H2A/H2B)

After a live boundary and current continuity receipt, substantive advancement
still requires one canonical route decision. The durable values are exactly
`PENDING`, `NOT_REQUIRED`, or `REQUIRED`. Absence, malformed state, stale
currentness, or incomplete evidence is `PENDING` and blocks advancement.
Governor reasoning, route prose, a transcript marker, child output, or a STATE
edit cannot mint or satisfy the decision.

## Explicit recovery v3 admission

The following explicit v3 variant is the sole exception to the ordinary
admission/lifecycle currentness and v2 capsule clauses in this file. It preserves every
ordinary currentness and effect gate.

The explicit v3 substitution applies throughout recovery decision, OPEN,
RETURN, COMPLETE and exact terminal idempotent readback: revalidate the native
occurrence, physical H0, original subject/ref custody and bound source/input
bytes instead of asserting ordinary current continuity. Its actual OPEN and
LOAD permit the identity-bound audit-state route announcement. This grants no
ordinary effect, next-task narration or historical cause attestation. The
separate state owner must complete publication/receipt/H0 lineage and prove
ordinary currentness before ordinary re-entry; its partial/completed retries
use that owner's exact predecessor and successor readbacks.

R0033 owns `route-recovery-decision.v1` only under explicit transaction-keyed
recovery entry. It shares ordinary CAS, admission, canonical byte validation,
child delivery, lifecycle chain and host receipt owners. It cannot occupy an
ordinary route ref or satisfy ordinary currentness/effect gates. The native
invocation, rather than capsule digest, is the v3 one-use key. Reconciliation
and successor publication remain under their existing state/receipt owners.

## Classification

`scripts/route-transaction.py` owns the versioned positive predicate:

- `MECHANICALLY_REQUIRED` produces `REQUIRED` for a known route trigger.
- `JUDGEMENT_REQUIRED` always produces `REQUIRED`; judgement cannot mint the
  cheap path.
- `MECHANICALLY_NOT_REQUIRED` is possible only for a closed non-trigger class:
  `MECHANICAL_CURRENTNESS_ACTION`, `PURE_BOUNDED_READ_OR_VALIDATION`,
  `EXACT_PACKAGE_OR_TOPOLOGY_VERIFICATION`, `SAFE_STATUS_OR_CONTAINMENT`, or
  `EXACT_ALREADY_BOUND_DETERMINISTIC_ACTION`.

The request is an action proposal, never its own evidence. It cannot supply
`CURRENT` assertions. The helper rehashes each repository-relative input,
derives the action class from a closed exact-argv/executable recognizer, binds
boundary and scope to the live continuity invalidation and Next action, reads
the current controller record and continuity receipt, validates the exact H0
event, and hashes the live HEAD/tree, executing route sources and exact child
source. Required triggers and judgement are derived from the admitted action,
not caller booleans. System executables must resolve through root/host-owned
custody and are digest-bound. Currentness argv must be a complete feasible
helper form. Pure read and safe-status classes use internal digest snapshots;
Git diff/status are not cheap-path executables, so repository filter helpers
cannot enter between the decision and action. Action environments strip shell
startup, exported-function, dynamic-loader and Git execution controls, and use
a trusted minimal `PATH`. Every trusted Git read-set command disables fsmonitor
and hooks before evidence is gathered.
Missing, mismatched, aliased or fabricated evidence stays `PENDING` or maps to
`REQUIRED`; caller-selected class labels cannot mint the cheap path.

### Pure read-only current-route validation

R0033 also exposes one owner-native pure validator for the C03 read-only fact
consumer. It reads the current route record, independently reacquires current
controller/claim/run/continuity custody, reconstructs only canonical `CURRENT`
request inputs from the writer-retained observed input set, and recomputes the
same classification, package, mapped-child source, whole-worktree/read-set, Git
metadata, expiry, transaction and obligation semantics. It validates lifecycle
shape through the canonical record reader, repeats current controller and route
observations, then ends with one exact controller-ref/route-ref identity-pair
fence. A noncurrent observed input cannot be reconstructed as caller intent and
fails closed.

This pure validator does not call the R003A store, attribute a current host
event, authorize an effect, mutate a ref or accept a host/store/path argument
from C03. Retained host/session fields remain immutable route dependencies, not
a claim about the current reader session. A tombstoned authoring session may
therefore leave an otherwise current route readable. Every `decide`, `check`,
`consume`, `open`, `return`, `complete` and `replay` path continues through the
compound effect predicate and mandatory exact active R003A attribution; a
tombstoned, foreign, stale or ambiguous session cannot authorize those paths.

### Request-free active-binding observation

`observe-current` accepts only the controller identity and the existing R003A
store, fixed host namespace, host-supplied session identity and current binding
generation. It accepts no request, route ref, claim, run root, continuity,
obligation, transaction, event, cwd or target locator, transcript, newest-run
selector or mirror claim. Under the shared Git-common namespace lock it derives
the sole route ref from the controller, requires exact canonical record bytes,
and builds an owner-local candidate from the record's boundary, scope, action
and strictly shaped ordered observed inputs.

That candidate is evidence, not authority. Missing inputs remain missing, and
stale rows retain their observed status and digest; either lossy form must fail
the shared current-result validation. The operation runs the same complete
controller, active R003A binding/event, predicate, fingerprint, history,
decision, classification, invalidator, transaction, obligation and H2B source-
event checks as `check`, then repeats the route, controller and full evaluation
fence. The derivation record and validated record must remain identical.

On success, `observe-current` emits the existing
`implementaudit.route-transaction-result.v1` envelope with internal mirror
claim `ABSENT`. The envelope projects the exact `route_transaction_id` already
validated against the current record and live predicate, paired with
`obligation_id` for `REQUIRED`; both fields are explicitly null for
`NOT_REQUIRED`. Current `NOT_REQUIRED` and `REQUIRED/SATISFIED` retain their
existing success meanings; `PENDING`, `REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED`, lossy, stale,
foreign, tombstoned, ambiguous or changed observations retain their existing
nonzero fail-closed meanings. Observation never enumerates cold history and
performs no decision, consume, lifecycle transition, ref/store/run-root write,
dispatch, package, host or external effect. Unlike the C03 pure validator, it
proves the currently supplied active binding and therefore rejects a
tombstoned authoring session.

`admit-current` accepts the same request-free binding arguments and reuses this
complete derivation and validation pipeline. It is the effect-bearing operation
behind `claim-run.sh --require-current-route`; callers cannot supply a request.
It exits zero only for exact current `NOT_REQUIRED` or exact current
`REQUIRED/SATISFIED`. The former emits exactly
`CHILD_SKILL_ROUTE=NOT_REQUIRED` and `No internal child is used because the
exact current R0033 route is NOT_REQUIRED.` without resolver, load or lifecycle
work. `PENDING`, `REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED`, stale, foreign, malformed, mismatched or
ambiguous state remains nonzero. `observe-current` remains a read-only result
projection, not the ordinary-effect gate.

The mechanically-not-required predicate also requires the exact current H0
host/session binding; current controller, claim, run, continuity generation and
receipt; exact boundary, scope, action and action class; current owner,
authority, effect and dependency evidence; a complete, uniquely ordered input
identity/digest set; current package and child-source identities; no missing,
stale or contradictory input; and no active same-controller obligation.

## Machine record and CAS

The canonical record is an immutable Git blob selected by
`refs/implementaudit/route-decisions/<controller>`. Every decision write is an
expected-old `git update-ref` CAS under a lock in the shared Git-common
namespace, followed by current ref/controller/binding rechecks. The record binds
the predicate version, H0 binding generation,
controller/claim/run/continuity, boundary, scope, exact action/class,
owner/authority/effect/dependency evidence, canonical inputs and digests,
package and child-source identities, predecessor, classification, outcome,
expiry fingerprint and current record identity.

`NOT_REQUIRED` is a scoped one-shot receipt, not a global exemption. `decide`
and `check` never authorize execution directly. `consume --expected-record
<oid>` rechecks every owner and first consumes the receipt by CAS to canonical
`PENDING/action-in-progress`. Only then does it execute the exact mechanically
vetted action. Normal success rechecks currentness and records a second
canonical `PENDING/action-completion` successor. Process loss at any point after
the first CAS leaves unknown completion fail-closed and cannot automatically
re-admit or replay the action. Normal completion returns `ACTION_COMPLETE`,
never an ephemeral allow that contradicts canonical PENDING. This cheap action
execution/completion is not H2B child completion. The receipt also
expires on any next-action, scope, read-set, binding, continuity,
package, child-source, owner, authority, dependency, effect, contradiction,
invalidation or scope-expansion change. Re-run `check` immediately before
`consume`. Independent work outside the bound controller/scope is not
blocked by another controller's obligation.

`REQUIRED` creates an obligation with route state `UNSATISFIED`. A child-bound
H2A decision uses `decide-transaction` and the canonical ref
`refs/implementaudit/route-transactions/<controller>/<transaction-digest>`;
the controller-scoped decision ref is not active child custody. H2A does not
open a child, admit child bytes or packet
identity, accept a child return, reread post-return currentness, or complete the
obligation. Those transitions belong to the H2B commands below. An active
obligation cannot ordinarily be downgraded or replaced. The sole exception is
the exact later-compaction stale-context recovery below; same-context and
ordinary active-obligation replacement remain forbidden.

Child cardinality is transaction-scoped: `MAX_CHILD_PER_ROUTE_TRANSACTION=1`.
The native OPEN path reads and CASes that transaction ref and persists the exact
controller, transaction and child admission under the Git common directory. It
admits disjoint same-controller transaction refs, rejects a second child
carrying the same `route_transaction_id`,
and reports `WRITER_CONFLICT` and `DEPENDENCY_CONFLICT` separately when their
exact typed keys overlap. It never asserts a controller-wide child maximum of
one. Failed pre-CAS OPEN releases only its identity-fenced admission and compact
capsule claim; terminal completion marks only its matching admission terminal,
so stale admission does not retain typed conflicts. Effect, resource and
host-capacity serialization remain with their typed owners. RETURN remains
buffered evidence until governor reconciliation.

Lifecycle projection never derives LOAD, USE or DISPOSE from route state or
return shape. The child may name three ordered identities in an
`implementaudit.holon-execution-evidence.v1` record, but the route owner grants
credit only after independently resolving exact immutable
`implementaudit.host-holon-stage-receipt.v1` bytes from the active host-owned
store. All three receipts must share the exact owner, host, session, binding
generation, selected child, packet, obligation and transaction, discriminate
LOAD/USE/DISPOSE in order, and have distinct identities. Otherwise the stages
are explicitly `unverified`; arbitrary hashes and RETURN-only evidence cannot
impersonate execution or disposal.

The `route-trigger` argv namespace is reserved. It admits only exactly two argv
elements—`route-trigger` and one reason from the closed map below—or the
separately validated three-element `QUERY_HISTORY_THEN_RESUME` form documented
below. An unknown reason token, a known reason with surplus argv, or a malformed
history query fails before route-record CAS and cannot degrade into an unmapped
judgment-required obligation. Unknown spellings are never aliases for a
canonical reason.

A terminal `REQUIRED/SATISFIED` one-shot lifecycle remains immutable, but it
does not permanently cap its controller. `decide` may create a fresh successor
only when the same controller, claim, run root and host are bound to the exact
next continuity; same-session custody must use a strictly later binding, while
fresh-session custody must use that distinct exact session's active local
binding without comparing session-local generation ordinals. The continuity
receipt must change, and the predicate-complete request must name a distinct
current boundary event and digest. The new record points directly to the
terminal record, owns no inherited child lifecycle bytes, and begins at
`UNSATISFIED` when its decision is `REQUIRED`. The old terminal record and its
packet, return and governor decision remain unchanged. Same-context or
same-boundary replay, skipped or stale continuity, stale or foreign binding,
standing-source state, and noncurrent predicates remain non-replaceable.

One narrower recovery applies after either a lifecycle-free
`REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED` record or an incomplete `OPEN` or `RETURNED` H2B
lifecycle is made stale by a real context boundary. A lifecycle-free record
must have no `lifecycle` key, must not own child lifecycle authority, and must
retain an exact self-consistent request, package, child-source, evidence,
fingerprint, obligation, transaction and H0 correlation. A non-null predecessor
must resolve to an exact same-controller route record and prove an allowed
direct transition: ordinary non-required succession, terminal re-entry, or
active stale-context recovery with the applicable decision, route-state,
owner, obligation, transaction, boundary, continuity and binding semantics.

Exactly two preserved immutable dead-route objects are allowlisted: historical
OID `ccf169415933de3f98fd75c54a2711ba1c060174` / record identity
`sha256:77e05b3db3afa24d979592e8aeecb83ce6fc56ab8499409834bd8e858b4320e7`,
and G027F OID `0b2929335e450d18260221243c394b8afceb7666` / record identity
`sha256:cfbbd8086bd71963da58bdaf9c74b766d829971a123892bafabeef118fea7e57`.
Each descriptor conjunctively pins its exact action identity, class, argv and
digest; exact `R0033:unadmitted` executable evidence; exact historical head,
tree and four-file package digest map; and
`R0033:UNMAPPED_REQUIRED:NO_CHILD` custody. Both are lifecycle-free,
`JUDGEMENT_REQUIRED`, unopenable and immutable. Only a later-boundary
`STALE_CONTEXT_RECONSTRUCTION` successor may recover either through the current
`audit-state` route. OID alone, record identity alone, or a structurally similar
record is insufficient. This allowlist does not admit any prospective unknown
or surplus trigger and does not relax mapped child custody.

The same controller, claim, run, host and host session may create only a fresh
successor after a complete bounded contiguous v3 continuity and matching H0
binding chain from the stale route to the current receipt. The current request
must carry a distinct canonical boundary event and digest, current inputs, and
the mechanically required `STALE_CONTEXT_RECONSTRUCTION` reason mapped solely
to `audit-state`. The new record points directly to the preserved incomplete
record, starts a fresh `REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED` obligation, and inherits no child,
packet, return, decision, transaction, obligation or satisfaction authority.
Same-context, skipped/stale-generation, foreign owner/session,
different-reason/child, malformed or missing predecessor/provenance,
noncurrent-input and old-lifecycle or old-credit reuse attempts fail closed.
Ordinary work stays blocked until the fresh audit-state return, one governor
completion and post-return currentness all succeed. This validates route
lineage selected by the canonical route ref; it does not claim independent
detection of a coordinated out-of-band replacement of that authoritative ref.
If an exact package relocation retired the old child path, only this recovery
`decide` may validate the incomplete lifecycle against its immutable bound
`child_source` and delivered bytes; all ordinary paths still require the
current mapped child, and the fresh audit-state route loads only current bytes.

## Bounded history routing

Routine route recovery consumes only verified current hot authority and reports
`history_read_performed: false`; it does not enumerate or hydrate immutable
event segments. When the exact action is `route-trigger
QUERY_HISTORY_THEN_RESUME iaevt-v1-<64-lowercase-hex>`, `decide` emits and records one
`implementaudit.history-query-request.v1` object with route
`QUERY_HISTORY_THEN_RESUME`, requirement `REQUIRED`, and a one-element ordered
`evidence_ids` list. The route remains `REQUIRED/JUDGEMENT_REQUIRED`. This is a
request for the later R0038 owner, not execution or satisfaction of that query.

An optional `--mirror-claim` is observation only. `check` reports
`IGNORED_CORROBORATION`, `IGNORED_CONTRADICTION`, or `IGNORED_ABSENT` against
the canonical decision/route state. A mirror or ActiveGraph claim never writes
the route ref, changes its result, or grants advancement.

## H2B child lifecycle and replay

`open --expected-record <oid> --packet <path>` accepts only the exact current
`REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED` record. It validates the immutable packet and stores the
full mapped child and packet bytes, byte counts, digests, and identities in
the canonical `OPEN` successor. The packet's source-event identity is bound to
the exact current host/session attribution and route obligation/transaction;
a caller-supplied label is not provenance, and its target must equal this
closed map:

| Required reason | Sole child |
|---|---|
| `STALE_CONTEXT_RECONSTRUCTION` | `audit-state` |
| `IMMUTABLE_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW` | `audit-assess` |
| `MAINTAINER_QUALIFICATION` | `audit-implement` |
| `NONTRIVIAL_ANDON_DIAGNOSIS` | `audit-andon` |

The existing resolver must select that exact child in the executing package or
standalone layout. Missing, extra, ambiguous, aliased, out-of-package,
unreadable, changed, wrong-name or wrong-version child bytes fail before visible
success. After the OPEN CAS, the ordinary currentness gate or explicit v3
native/custody gate, and exact child/packet reread, the
owner emits once on its diagnostic stream:

```text
CHILD_SKILL_ROUTE=<mapped-child>
I'm using <mapped-child> to <exact bounded reason>.
```

Process loss after OPEN but before those lines remains non-admitted and requires
governed recovery. `return --expected-record <oid> --return <path>` accepts only
a return bound to that obligation, route transaction, and packet digest. For
`audit-state`, the payload must additionally be the closed
`implementaudit.audit-state-minimum-frontier-return.v1` record: exact compact
event and capsule digest, child, packet, obligation and transaction; only
the exact ordered `EVENT`, `CAPSULE`, `PACKET`, `OBLIGATION` and
`ROUTE_TRANSACTION` digest identities, closed unresolved-obligation and
contradiction references, and one closed typed edge with a digest target; and
`context_disposition=DISCARD_AFTER_RETURN`. Top-level or nested raw canonical
content, encoded JSON/YAML/Markdown, multiline or oversized scalars, aliases,
a missing frontier, a foreign event/capsule or replay cannot enter canonical
RETURN. The
command independently resolves any execution receipts before storing its exact
bytes as the canonical `RETURNED` successor. Neither state advances.

`complete --expected-record <oid> --packet <path> --return <path> --decision
<path>` rereads controller, ordinary continuity (v3 substitutes exact native
occurrence and predecessor custody), host binding, predicate, child, packet,
and the same live return before recording a canonical `SATISFIED` successor. A
decision must bind the exact return digest. Every lifecycle read revalidates the
embedded child, packet, return, and decision bytes against the exact current
mapped child and the original `REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED` authority. The
lifecycle admits exactly one governor decision; replaying that identical
completion is idempotent and emits no second record. Only a current
`REQUIRED/SATISFIED` request-free admission grants an ordinary governed effect.
Child output always returns to the governor and cannot select a second child;
only a fresh current R0033 transaction can do that.

The Stop consumer requires a closed, Stop-event-bound abnormality
classification rather than a lexical guess over model prose. The packaged
standard Stop hook currently has no trusted producer for this semantic record:
parallel hooks receive the same immutable event and cannot manufacture the
classification from prose or route shape. Therefore the installed path remains
`UNCLASSIFIED`/non-authorizing until a host-owned trusted producer capability is
available. `SUBSTANTIVE` requires the exact
reconciled `audit-andon` lifecycle with authority ceiling `NONE`; absent,
malformed, stale or foreign classification is non-authorizing. `NONE` and a
known deterministic `MECHANICAL` mismatch retain the cheap path and open no
ceremonial child. Any child requester receives
`STOP_CHILD_TO_CHILD_DISPATCH` and must return to the governor.

`replay --expected-record <oid> --event <path>` compares immutable source-event
identity plus canonical body, kind, reactivation flags, and host-correlation
provenance, not message text alone. Reconstructed `E1` for a satisfied one-shot
is a zero-effect `REPLAY_NO_OP`. A host-bound distinct `E2` remains distinct
even if its body is identical, while an already-terminal target is a zero-effect
`TERMINAL_NO_OP` unless its event explicitly carries reopen, target-change, or
invalidating evidence. Missing, unreadable, malformed, unbound, ambiguous, or
identity-conflicting provenance returns one typed `ambiguous` STOP with no
issuance, transition, authorization, dispatch, or effect. An outstanding
standing constraint with the same source identity remains `STANDING_APPLIES`;
it is not converted into a new instruction row.

## Projection and proof boundary

STATE carries only `Route decision projection` and `Route decision record`.
Those rows may report the canonical record, but are never authority; a direct
edit has no effect and disagreement is an invalid projection. The source core
does not prove package inclusion, installation, native host activation, READY,
JOIN, lifecycle closure beyond its exact route obligation, or
`AUDIT_COMPLETE`.

Rollback removes the helper, reference, wrapper route and template projection.
Preserve any immutable `REQUIRED/UNSATISFIED` blob or receipt as unsatisfied
evidence; do not rewrite it into `NOT_REQUIRED` or completion.


## Versioned native attempts and unaccepted recovery disposition

The prospective contract in continuity.md selects post-compaction-recovery.v4,
predicate R0033.recovery-cognition.v2 and frontier-return.v2 for new attempts.
Old v2/v3 capsules and v1 return schemas retain exact historical validation.
The authenticated NativeRecoveryObserver supplies a bounded complete new-turn
conduct interval, with a distinct prior-turn terminal witness and body-free
compaction markers. OPEN freezes its qualified envelope in
lifecycle.attempt_evidence; RETURN/COMPLETE revalidate the exact native prefix.
The isolated child must explicitly admit that evidence before hot reads, and
its successful v2 return binds attempt_admission to the exact evidence digest.
Unknown conduct or intervening affected-attempt boundaries yield refusal.

The new abandon-recovery command consumes a separately reviewed disposition
plan and actual host execution receipts. It changes only the exact owned
transaction ref to ABANDONED after old-record/native/H0/source/one-use checks,
retains the original lifecycle and source identity, and releases only the
matched admission after terminal readback. The old native invocation remains
consumed. Repeated exact terminal readback may finish interrupted cleanup;
foreign, stale or uncertain state grants no release, cognition or currentness.
It uses existing route/admission/one-use stores, not a new registry or controller.
See continuity.md for the closed refusal, source-transition and human-input
boundaries. No old return is retroactively admitted under these new semantics.
